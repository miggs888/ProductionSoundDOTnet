            Michael's career began in 2005. A fresh graduate of Queens College, he quickly landed a full-time job as the Assistant Equipment Manager at a production services company in Manhattan. His daily tasks included getting gear ready for upcoming shoots, checking in gear from wrapped shoots, and maintaining the working order of the equipment room's inventory of cameras, audio mixers, lights, tripods, and other miscellaneous gear. This gave him invaluable hands-on experience with a variety of production gear, and sparked his desire to be in the field. He began going out on shoots, learning on-set etiquette, and lending a hand where he could. 
            <br><br>
              After doing this for some time, he wanted to play a more integral role in the production team, which led him to pursue sound recording. When not on set, he learned everything he could about audio mixers, microphones, lavaliers, and mixing/recording techniques. He soon began going out as a production sound mixer on small three-person ENG crews where he also assisted with setting up lights, tripod, monitor, etc.
              <br><br>
              In November of 2008, Michael took his career to the next level and went freelance. He began building his kit which started out consisting of a Wendt X5 5-channel mixer, 2 Lectrosonics wireless, a K-Tek boom, and a Sennheiser MKH60 shotgun microphone. Over the years, this kit gradually expanded to become the arsenal of gear that he now owns, capable of handling nearly any size production.
              <br><br>
              Michael's career has taken him all over the United States and abroad. He has been fortunate enough to experience things that most people are not given access to. Tagging sharks with Jimmy Buffet, filming a mother giving birth in the wilderness of Alaska, traveling across America to film in haunted locations, and being embedded with the National Guard after Hurricane Sandy, Michael has seen a lot but he has not seen it all. 
              <br><br>
              Whether your production is large or small, on a boat or in an office building, Michael has your audio needs covered. </p>
